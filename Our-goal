# Our goals for the CBL Programming Language


We want kids to learn programming in an easy way so we made a language that is based off Python and we call it CBL.
We believe kids should learn how to code, so we made an easy to learn language. 

# Next steps

We obviously want improvements to happen. One of our next phases is to develop the file extension format for CBL, which is .cbllang

As our goal of improving CBL, we want you to put your thoughts on what to improve for the CBL languagem, so we are developing the discussion forums to help us improve.
