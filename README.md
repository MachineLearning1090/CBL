# CBL
CBL stands for Children's Basic Language. CBL is designed for kid coders who are interested in programming. CBL is easy to use and it is based of the popular programming language, Python.
CBL uses some of python's basic syntaxes and it uses the extension of .py. You can obviously run CBL Code as long as you put the import cbl statement on top of the line.
# Why CBL
CBL is designed for children, it uses the function display() instead of print(). Display is like print, only that it is much more clear to a kid that has no programming experience.

# Next Steps
If the kid already knows CBL, you can move on to Python since CBL is built with Python, then Python code is easier to understand.
